Good programming language frameworks make it easy to produce quality products faster. Great frameworks even make the whole development experience enjoyable. **FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance), a web framework for building APIs with Python. It is easy to learn, fast to code, and production-ready. The most exciting feature of FastAPI is that it supports asynchronous code out of the box using the async/await Python keywords.
